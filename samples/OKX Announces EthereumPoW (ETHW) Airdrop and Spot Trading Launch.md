# OKX Announces EthereumPoW (ETHW) Airdrop and Spot Trading Launch  

In a strategic move to enhance user engagement and expand its cryptocurrency offerings, OKX has announced the distribution of EthereumPoW (ETHW) tokens through an airdrop campaign while simultaneously launching spot trading for the asset. This development marks a significant milestone for both OKX and the broader crypto ecosystem, offering users opportunities to participate in emerging blockchain technologies.  

## EthereumPoW Airdrop Distribution Details  

OKX initiated the ETHW airdrop on September 15, 2022, rewarding Ethereum (ETH) holders on the platform with proportional allocations of the newly forked token. The distribution mechanism ensures that users who held ETH in their OKX accounts at the time of the snapshot automatically receive ETHW tokens, with balances accessible under the "Assets > My Assets > Funding Account" section.  

### Key Airdrop Considerations:  
- **Processing Time**: Recipients should allow up to 24 hours for ETHW balances to reflect in their accounts after distribution begins.  
- **Sub-Account Consolidation**: Users with sub-accounts will see their ETHW rewards aggregated into the parent account, ensuring unified management of the newly acquired asset.  

## ETHW Spot Trading Activation  

To facilitate seamless liquidity and price discovery, OKX has integrated ETHW into its spot trading markets. This move enables users to trade ETHW against major pairs like USDT, enhancing accessibility for both retail and institutional investors.

## Understanding EthereumPoW (ETHW)  

**EthereumPoW (ETHW)** emerged as a Layer 1 blockchain following a hard fork of the Ethereum network on September 15, 2022. Unlike the upgraded Ethereum protocol that transitioned to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) via "The Merge," ETHW preserves the original Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. This divergence creates unique opportunities and challenges for miners, developers, and investors.  

### Core Characteristics of ETHW:  
- **Unlimited Supply**: Unlike ETH's deflationary model post-Merge, ETHW maintains an inflationary supply structure.  
- **PoW Persistence**: By retaining mining as its validation method, ETHW appeals to communities advocating for decentralized, hardware-driven consensus.  
- **Ecosystem Potential**: Developers may leverage ETHW's infrastructure to deploy decentralized applications (dApps) compatible with Ethereum's pre-Merge architecture.
