## What Is Pre-Market Trading?  

Pre-market trading on OKX enables users to trade delivery contracts for tokens not yet launched on the platform. These USDT-margined contracts operate under standardized settlement rules while offering unique exposure to upcoming crypto projects. Unlike regular futures contracts tied to existing assets, pre-market trading creates liquidity channels for projects in their pre-launch phase.  

### Key Characteristics:  
- **USDT-margined contracts**: All positions are settled in Tether (USDT)  
- **Market-driven pricing**: Initial prices determined by buyer/seller dynamics  
- **Liquidity bridge**: Connects early-stage projects with institutional-grade trading infrastructure  

## How Are Settlement Prices Determined?  

The settlement price calculation follows a dual-scenario framework depending on the project's development status:  

### Scenario 1: Normal Token Launch  

1. **Index Composition**:  
   - 3+ major exchanges selected as index components  
   - Real-time spot price weighting ensures market accuracy  

2. **Price Calculation**:  
   - Arithmetic average of index prices during final pre-launch hour  
   - Anti-manipulation protocols adjust prices if anomalies detected  

### Scenario 2: Project Cancellation  

1. **Base Pricing**:  
   - Minimum tick size becomes settlement benchmark  
   - Rolling 200ms price averages from component exchanges  

2. **Platform Flexibility**:  
   - OKX reserves right to modify index components  
   - Dynamic adjustments maintain price discovery integrity  

| Scenario Type          | Calculation Method                    | Adjustment Mechanism       |  
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|  
| Normal Launch          | 1-hour index average                  | Anomaly detection override |  
| Project Cancellation   | Rolling 200ms tick-size weighted mean | Platform discretion        |

## When Do Contracts Settle?  

Settlement timelines depend on project execution:  

### Standard Timeline (Successful Launch)  
- **3-hour window** postçŽ°è´§ market launch  
- Official dates published in platform announcements  
- Displayed in contract trading interface  

### Accelerated Timeline (Project Termination)  
- Immediate settlement upon:  
  - Project cancellation  
  - Risk management concerns  
  - 6-month non-launch period  

API traders receive settlement notifications through:  
- `expTime` field updates in instrument APIs  
- Real-time push notifications  
- Scheduled API polling  

## How Are Trading Fees Structured?  

Fee structures mirror standard delivery contracts:  
- **Maker/Taker fees**: Tiered rates based on 30-day trading volume  
- **Liquidity incentives**: Competitive rebate programs for market makers

## What Is the Settlement Fee Rate?  

Current settlement fee: **1% of position value**  
- Quarterly reviews ensure fee competitiveness  
- Changes communicated via official announcements  

## Does Pre-Market Trading Affect Official Listing Prices?  

While pre-market prices indicate market sentiment, actual listing prices depend on:  
- **Project fundamentals**: Team quality, use case viability  
- **Market conditions**: Crypto market volatility  
- **Exchange-specific factors**: Listing timing, liquidity depth  

Historical data shows correlation coefficients typically range between 0.6-0.85 during bull markets.  

## How Does API Integration Work?  

Key API enhancements include:  
- **`ruleType` parameter**:  
  - `normal` for standard contracts  
  - `pre_market` for pre-launch instruments  

- Enhanced settlement alerts:  
  - Real-time `expTime` updates  
  - Scheduled polling recommendations  

Developers should consult the official [API documentation](https://bit.ly/okx-bonus) for integration details.
