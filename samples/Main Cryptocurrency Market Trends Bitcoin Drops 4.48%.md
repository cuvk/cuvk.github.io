## Key Drivers of Cryptocurrency Volatility

### 1. Investor Sentiment and Market Psychology
Cryptocurrency markets are heavily influenced by social media trends, whale transactions, and speculative trading. For instance, Litecoin's unexpected 10.47% surge highlights how smaller-cap assets can experience dramatic swings due to concentrated buying activity.

### 2. Technological Developments
Upgrades to blockchain protocols, such as Ethereum's ongoing scalability improvements, often precede price movements. Conversely, security breaches or failed network upgrades can trigger sharp declines.

### 3. Global Economic Conditions
The correlation between traditional financial markets and crypto assets has strengthened in recent years. Stock market corrections frequently spill over into the **digital assets** sector.
