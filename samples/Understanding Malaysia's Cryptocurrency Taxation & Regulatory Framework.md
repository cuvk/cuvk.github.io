## Cryptocurrency Taxation in Malaysia

### Legal Classification of Digital Assets
Malaysia distinguishes between **cryptocurrency** (not legal tender) and **digital assets** (regulated securities). The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) categorizes certain tokens as **securities** under the Capital Markets and Services Act (CMSA) if they meet investment contract criteria.

### Taxation Principles
While Malaysia doesn't impose **capital gains tax** on crypto holdings, the Inland Revenue Board (IRB) applies income tax principles:

- **Active traders** (day traders) face:
  - Income tax on profits
  - Deductible business expenses
  - 30% tax rate for foreign individuals

- **Long-term holders** (non-traders) enjoy:
  - No capital gains tax
  - Tax exemption on appreciation
  - Taxation only when crypto is:
    - Used for business transactions
    - Converted to fiat currency
    - Exchanged for goods/services

### Determining Taxable Activities
The IRB uses eight criteria to identify taxable crypto traders:

1. Large transaction volumes
2. Short holding periods
3. High trading frequency
4. Marketing crypto assets
5. Non-compulsory sales
6. Commercial intent
7. Short-term financing for purchases
8. Business documentation

## Regulatory Framework Evolution

### Dual Regulatory Structure
Malaysia employs a **two-tier system**:
- **Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM)**: Focuses on payment systems and AML/CFT compliance
