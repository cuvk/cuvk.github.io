# Crypto.com to Burn 70B CRO Tokens Ahead of Full Blockchain Launch

## The Largest Token Burn in Cryptocurrency History  

Cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com has announced a landmark token burn event, set to destroy **70 billion CRO tokens** ahead of its mainnet blockchain launch in March. Described by the company as *"the largest token burn in history,"* this strategic move aims to reshape the economic model of its native cryptocurrency while preparing for the decentralized future of its Crypto.org Chain network.

The initial burn of **59.6 billion CRO tokens** will commence on Monday, with the remaining **10.4 billion** tokens scheduled for monthly destruction as they unlock from smart contracts. This aggressive reduction in supply aligns with Crypto.com's commitment to achieving full decentralization of its blockchain infrastructure.

## Strategic Implications for CRO Tokenomics  

The token burn will drastically alter the circulating supply dynamics of CRO, increasing its availability from the current **24% to over 80%** of the total supply. This shift addresses criticisms of centralized token distribution while creating potential scarcity value for remaining holders.

### Key Token Burn Timeline:
- **Initial Burn**: 59.6B CRO tokens (Immediate)
- **Scheduled Burns**: 10.4B CRO tokens (Monthly until completion)
- **Post-Burn Allocation**: 5.9B CRO tokens reserved for block rewards and ecosystem development

## Crypto.org Chain: A New Era for Blockchain Innovation  

The token burn coincides with the upcoming launch of **Crypto.org Chain** on mainnet March 25. This open-source, permissionless blockchain will serve as the foundation for Crypto.com's ecosystem, enabling high-speed transactions at low costs while supporting decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible token (NFT) development.

### Core Features of Crypto.org Chain:
| Feature                | Benefit                              |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Native Currency         | CRO token integration                |
| High Throughput         | 5,000+ TPS capacity                  |
| Developer-Friendly     | Smart contract support               |
| Ecosystem Synergy      | 5M+ user base access                 |

CEO Kris Marszalek emphasized the strategic importance of this transition: *"By building our payments, DeFi and NFT offerings on Crypto.org Chain, we're creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that benefits from superior infrastructure while maintaining seamless integration with our existing user base."*
