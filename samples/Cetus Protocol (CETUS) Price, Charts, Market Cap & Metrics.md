### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How does Cetus Protocol differ from traditional DEXs?**  
A: Unlike standard automated market makers, Cetus employs concentrated liquidity positions that allow providers to allocate capital within specific price ranges, significantly improving capital efficiency compared to traditional constant product models.

**Q: What makes CLMM superior to standard AMM models?**  
A: CLMM (Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker) models enable liquidity providers to focus their capital within active trading ranges, reducing idle assets and improving yield potential. This approach can generate up to 10x more efficient liquidity provision compared to traditional AMMs.

**Q: How can users participate in Cetus Protocol?**  
A: Users have multiple participation options: trading assets with minimal slippage, providing liquidity through concentrated positions, staking xCETUS for yield, or developing on the protocol through available SDKs.

**Q: What security measures protect the protocol?**  
A: Cetus implements multiple security layers including formal verification of smart contracts, regular third-party audits, and a bug bounty program incentivizing ethical hackers to identify vulnerabilities.

**Q: How does the xCETUS token work?**  
A: xCETUS represents staked CETUS tokens with enhanced benefits including: proportional share of protocol fees, boosted yield rewards, and governance voting power. The token uses a bonding curve mechanism to maintain economic balance.
