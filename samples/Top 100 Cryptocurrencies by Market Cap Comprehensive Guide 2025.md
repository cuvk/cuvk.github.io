## How Market Capitalization Works in Cryptocurrency  

Market capitalization (market cap) measures a cryptocurrency's total value by multiplying its circulating supply by its current price. This metric helps investors assess relative size, liquidity, and market confidence. While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) consistently dominate the rankings, emerging projects like Solana (SOL) and meme coins such as PEPE demonstrate how rapidly the market evolves.  

**Example Calculation**:  
If a cryptocurrency has 100 million circulating coins priced at $50 each, its market cap equals $5 billion.

## FAQs About Top Cryptocurrencies  

### **What determines a cryptocurrency's market cap ranking?**  
Market cap rankings depend on circulating supply multiplied by price. However, tokens with low liquidity or large whale holdings can skew perceptions of actual value.  

### **Are meme coins like DOGE and SHIB worth investing in?**  
Meme coins carry high risk due to volatility and speculative nature. Allocate only small portions of your portfolio (e.g., 1-2%) to these assets.  

### **How do stablecoins maintain their rankings?**  
Stablecoins like USDT and USDC retain positions through consistent demand for fiat on/off-ramps and DeFi liquidity provision.  

### **What tools track real-time crypto rankings?**  
CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and OKX's crypto explorer provide live data and historical comparisons.  

### **Should I invest solely in top 10 cryptocurrencies?**  
While safer, top 10 assets offer limited growth potential compared to mid-cap projects. Balance your portfolio with 70% top-tier coins and 30% promising altcoins.
