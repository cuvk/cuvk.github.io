## A Historical Journey of Bitcoin's Price Milestones

### The Early Days: From $0 to $100
When Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin in 2009, it had no monetary value. The first recorded transaction occurred in 2010 when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz famously paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas. By 2013, Bitcoin broke the **$100** barrier for the first time, peaking at $111. This initial surge drew global attention to the potential of decentralized digital currency.

### The $1,000 Breakthrough
Later in 2013, Bitcoin experienced its first major bull run, reaching **$1,000** by December. This milestone sparked debates about its viability as a mainstream financial instrument and attracted both enthusiastic investors and regulatory scrutiny.

### The 2017 Bull Market: $10,000 and Beyond
Four years later, Bitcoin reentered the spotlight during the 2017 bull market, surpassing **$10,000** in November. Institutional interest began to grow, with companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla later adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This period solidified Bitcoinâ€™s reputation as a disruptive force in finance.
