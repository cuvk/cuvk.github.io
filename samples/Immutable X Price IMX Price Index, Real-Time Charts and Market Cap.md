# Immutable X Price | IMX Price Index, Real-Time Charts and Market Cap

## Understanding Immutable X and IMX  

Immutable X is a **layer 2 scaling solution** designed to address the challenges of NFTs and web3 gaming on Ethereum. By leveraging advanced zero-knowledge rollup (ZK-rollup) technology, it enables carbon-neutral NFT transactions with zero gas fees. The platformâ€™s native token, **IMX (ERC-20)**, serves multiple purposes: paying protocol fees, earning passive income through staking, and participating in decentralized governance.

### Ethereumâ€™s Scalability Challenges  
Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchains for NFTs, faces significant scalability issues. With a transaction throughput of just 5â€“15 transactions per second (TPS), network congestion often leads to high gas fees. Immutable X solves this by offloading transaction processing to its layer 2 infrastructure while maintaining Ethereumâ€™s security guarantees. This allows NFT trading to achieve speeds comparable to traditional e-commerce platforms.  

### ZK-Rollup Technology: The Core Innovation  
Immutable X utilizes **ZK-STARK proofs** developed by StarkWare to bundle thousands of off-chain NFT transactions into a single cryptographic proof. This ensures transaction validity while drastically reducing computational overhead. Developers benefit from Immutable Xâ€™s REST APIs, which simplify the creation of NFT marketplaces and decentralized applications (dApps).  

## How to Use Immutable X  

### Wallet Integration with Link  
Users can connect their Ethereum wallets to Immutable X via **Link**, a middleware solution. Once connected, they can trade NFTs across Immutable X-powered marketplaces. The platform also plans to integrate with OpenSea, a leading NFT trading hub, to expand its user base.
