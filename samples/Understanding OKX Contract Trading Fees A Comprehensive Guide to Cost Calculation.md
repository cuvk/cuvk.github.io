## Core Components of OKX Contract Fees  

### 1. Point Fees: The Foundation of Trading Costs  
Point fees form the primary cost of holding positions on OKX. These fees are calculated based on three key factors:  
- **Currency Pair**: Fees vary for BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, and other pairs.  
- **Contract Type**: Perpetual contracts (no expiration) vs. futures contracts (fixed expiration).  
- **Market Conditions**: Fluctuations in price directly impact fee amounts.  

#### Point Fee Formula  
The formula for point fees is straightforward:  
$$
\text{Point Fee} = \text{Position Value} \times \text{Fee Rate}
$$  
For example, a BTC/USDT perpetual contract with a position value of $10,000 and a 0.1% fee rate incurs a $10 point fee.  

**Pro Tip**: OKX frequently updates fee rates. Check their official announcements for the latest **OKX fee structure** details.

### 2. Slippage Fees: Managing Market Volatility  
Slippage fees compensate for the difference between expected and executed trade prices during high volatility. Unlike point fees, slippage fees depend on:  
- **Order Placement Time**: Orders placed during low liquidity periods may face higher slippage.  
- **Market Depth**: The volume of buy/sell orders at specific price levels.  

#### Slippage Fee Calculation  
While OKX does not publicly disclose a fixed formula, slippage fees are typically derived from:  
$$
\text{Slippage Cost} = (\text{Market Price} - \text{Order Price}) \times \text{Position Size}
$$  
For instance, if you place a buy order at $30,000 for BTC but it executes at $30,100, the slippage cost for a 1 BTC position is $100.

## Real-World Example: BTC/USDT Perpetual Contract  
Letâ€™s apply the concepts to a practical scenario:  

| **Parameter**         | **Value**                |  
|-----------------------|--------------------------|  
| Position Size         | 0.5 BTC ($15,000)        |  
| Fee Rate              | 0.1%                     |  
| Slippage Tolerance    | Â±1%                      |  

**Total Point Fee**: $15,000 Ã— 0.1% = **$15**  
**Potential Slippage Cost**: $15,000 Ã— 1% = **$150**  

*Total Estimated Cost*: $15 + $150 = **$165**
